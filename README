##### Linux privilege checker #####

Searches for privileges, service settings, sensitive information, running
processes, installed programs, network statistics, logs, permissions and  various other information about the system.

Suggests exploits based on the detected kernel version.

Inspired from g0tm1lk's cheatsheet, available at http://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation.html


NOTES

Full output may be excessive, I tried to break it down in specific functions to make it easy to check for relevant information only by commenting out the unnecessary bits.

It's using the subprocess module for running commands.

Running time may vary, with all checks enabled it took ~1min on a freshly installed Debian and ~4min on a custom Kali system.

Regarding the exploit finding functionality:

- in the vulnerable kernels, I prioritized the versions given in the respective CVE, unless specified otherwise in the 
exploit source code

- there is some redundancy in the exploit dictionaries, because I wanted to keep them classified in 
kernel versions (2.4, 2.6, etc.)

- some CVEs have multiple exploits available, I tried getting the verified ones, and those which were stable and up-to-date

- some false positives / negatives are inevitable
